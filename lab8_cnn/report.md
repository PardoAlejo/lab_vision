1. Network Description

Our neural network is formed by 5, the structure is shown below:

IMAGEN 

The three convolutional layers are used to extract specific patterns inside the input images. This is made by calculting image responses to different filters created previously. 
Additionally, the pooling layers were implemented in order obtain relevant information in each of the images. This information results relevant because it represents interest points inside the image independtly? Of its scale.

2. Results

Results on Train set are shown below:
